## React.js
- Use React for the front-end layer of your marketplace.
- The UI can be split into multiple features: product discovery, seller dashboard, shopping cart, user account, etc.

## Micro Frontends (MFE)
- Break down the React application into distinct micro frontends that can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.
**Example MFE modules:**
- Catalog MFE: Lists products, shows product details.
- Search/Discovery MFE: Handles the advanced search and product filtering.
- Cart & Checkout MFE: Manages shopping cart, payment flow, and order summaries.
- User/Seller Profile MFE: Handles user authentication, profile management, and reviews.

## Node.js + Express.js
- Use Node.js and Express.js to build the core backend for user authentication, business logic, order management, payment integrations, etc.
- This backend will expose your GraphQL APIs (and possibly REST endpoints for certain integrations).

## GraphQL
- Implement a GraphQL layer on top of your Express server to provide a flexible and efficient data query mechanism.
- You can define types such as User, Product, Order, Review, etc.
- GraphQL resolvers can fetch and combine data from MongoDB, Elasticsearch (for search requests), and external payment services (e.g., Stripe).

## MongoDB
- Use MongoDB to store structured and semi-structured data:
- User documents (names, emails, hashed passwords, etc.)
- Product documents (title, description, price, seller info, etc.)
- Order documents (items, user, order status, timestamps, etc.)
- Review documents (ratings, comments, references to product/user)
- MongoDBâ€™s flexible schema allows for quick iteration as features evolve.

## Elasticsearch
- Power the advanced search functionalities. For example:
- Full-text search on product titles and descriptions
- Faceted search (filter by category, price range, location, etc.)
- Auto-complete suggestions
- Sync relevant data from MongoDB to Elasticsearch (e.g., via an event-based system or a periodic data sync).

## AWS
- Host your microservices and micro frontends on AWS. Possible services:
- **Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS)** or **Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)** for container orchestration of Node.js microservices.
- **AWS Lambda** for serverless functions (e.g., handling image processing or background tasks).
- **AWS S3 + CloudFront** for hosting static assets of your micro frontends (React builds).
- **Amazon EC2** for general-purpose servers if you prefer a more traditional approach over containers.
- **Amazon Elasticsearch Service (OpenSearch)** for running and scaling your search cluster.
- **Amazon RDS or DocumentDB** if you want managed solutions for MongoDB (or you can self-host on EC2).
